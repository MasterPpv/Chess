 * It has a strange movement pattern - it can choose between moving one
 * space up, right, left, or down in a given direction and then two spaces
 * in a direction perpendicular to the first, or moving two spaces in a
 * given direction first and then one space in a perpendicular direction.
 * It is worth approximately 3 pawns, and can pass through other pieces.
