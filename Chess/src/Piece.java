/**
 * The basic representation of a piece in chess. Each piece should know
 * its location on the board, as well as what squares it can legally move
 * to or not move to. Each piece has a color associated with it, which
 * represents which player's side it is on, and each piece has the ability
 * to capture opposing pieces and remove them from the game.
